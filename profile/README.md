- The publication dates of the commits contained in these repositories may differ considerably from their actual authoring date.
- The commit history of some repositories may be partially or totally hidden.
- Histories containing commits from other users will not be totally hidden in order to respect attribution, unless said party has explicitly contacted me and instructed to have any proof of authorship publicly removed.
- The projects available contain proofs of concept and generally subpar code, provided with absolutely no guarantee.
- Once published, the repositories will be archived and considered final. No further modifications will be made. No issues or pull requests will be accepted.

### Responsible publication notice
